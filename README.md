this repo contains finished WebGL Games created by the members of Deep Space Mainz. It only contains the compiled code, this repo is only here to host the games for free. 

## What is Deep Space Mainz
Deep Space Mainz is a project for anyone who has always wanted to work with 3D printing, microcontrollers, or programming languages but lacks the equipment or knowledge to get started. Every Wednesday from 5 PM, you can join us to get creative. We provide the hardware, but you are welcome to bring your own device. Our goal is to support you with your project and teach you how to work with programming languages. Even if you have never programmed or worked with 3D printers before, but are motivated, feel free to come by and expand your skills.
